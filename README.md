# Programming3-Frontend

React.js based website

## Hosting

You can currently access the website with the following link: https://programming3frontend.web.app/

## UnitTests

Instead of Travis CI, we used the local GitHub workflows pipeline to automatically test our unit tests on each pull request made into the main branch, as well as the main branch itself. You can see below the status of the current main branch.

![GitHub Workflow Status](https://img.shields.io/github/workflow/status/Benedict-Carling/Programming3-Frontend/React%20Unittests)

The workflow initiator file can be seen within the `.github/workflows/` folder and the unit tests themselves can be found within `src/__tests__` folder
